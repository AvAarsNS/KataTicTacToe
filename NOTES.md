✔ Create empty board

We want to place markers:

✔ Place an X in the bottom right
✔ Place an O in the center

We want to detect X wins in the first column:
✔ One X in first column: no win
✴ Three Xes in first column: win!
- Two Xes in first column: no win

We want to detect X wins in other columns:
- Three Xes in third column: win!

We want to detect column wins for O:
- Three O's in second column: win
- Three Xes in second column: no win for O
