# Kata Tic Tac Toe

## First pomodoro
Be able to create an empty game board,
Place player markers, and maybe even detect the first win condition

✔ Create empty board

We want to place markers:
✔ Place an X in the top left
✔ Place an X in the top center
✔ Place an X in the bottom right
✔ Place an O in the center

We want to detect X wins in the first column:
✔ One X in first column: no win
✔ Three Xes in first column: win!
✔ Two Xes in first column: no win

We want to detect X wins in other columns:
✔ Three Xes in third column: win!

We want to detect column wins for O:
✔ Three O's in second column: win
✔ Three Xes in second column: no win for O

POMODORO OVER, NOW HALF HOUR BREAK BECAUSE OF DAILY

## Second pomodoro
First, we want to test the second UAT, so we have a complete story
Then, we want to be able to detect horizontal lines, followed by diagonals

✴ UAT Scenario 2

We want to detect horizontal wins:
- One X in first row: no win
- Three Xes in first row: win!
- Three Xes in second row: win!
- Three O's in third row: win!

We want to detect diagonal wins:
- ↘ X: win
- ↗ O: win
